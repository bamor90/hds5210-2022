# Feedback on Final

Without an introduction and clear documentaiton, I found your project difficult to follow.  Here are my notes on the scores below.
1. You used only CSV files as your input format.
2. I only saw one example of merging your data together.
3. I didn't see any use of functions to create abstraction or encapsulation in your project.

What you demonstrated in this project is good, but it fell short of receiving full marks based on the scoring rubric.
