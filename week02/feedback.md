# Feedback

Refer to the homework rubric posted on Canvas (https://canvas.slu.edu/courses/28045/rubrics/23670) for additional notes on the approach I take to grading weekly assignments. Basically, you'll receive 4 points for correctness of your multiple choice responses, 4 points for correctness of the programming exercises, and 2 points based on your level of programming "craft", i.e. Did you use good variable names, format code in a way that was easy to read, etc.

You will see your grades with a brief explanation in Canvas.

If I have more substantial feedback or what to show you code examples / corrections, I'll post them in a file like this back to your repository.  You'll need to make sure you do a `git pull` in your Jupyter repository to retrieve my comments before you can submit your next batch of exercises.


# Week 2 Notes

5.5 and 5.6 - Note that in Python (and most programming languages), you can't use spaces in variable names or function names. It would be hard for the computer to know if that string of words is one command or several separate commands, so the programming language requires no spaces in your variable names and function names.  Instead, one of the conventions is to use an underscore between words. For example: `hours_worked_a_week` instead of `hours worked a week`.  Even better, something like `work_hours(weeks)` would suffice.  The function tells you what it is going to return, `work_hours`, and the parameter name tells you what the input is expected to be, `weeks`.
